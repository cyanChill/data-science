# Predicting Used Car Prices

Suppose we have the following problem:

> Tom wants to sell his car, but doesn't know how much he should sell it for. He wants to sell it for as much as possible, but also have it be reasonably priced so someone would want to purchase it. How can we help Tom determine the best price for the car?

In short: `Can we estimate the price of a used car based on its characteristics?`.
